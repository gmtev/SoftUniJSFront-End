# SoftUniJSFront-End
In this repository I'm going to store the JS code I've written for SoftUni's "JS Front-End" course. The uploads will consist of exercises from the course, exam preparations and the exam itself. The HTML and CSS files are part of the resources for the tasks, meaning that they are provided ready by SoftUni and are not written/modified by the students.
